This is the INSTALL file for the lacaml distribution.

This package uses OASIS to generate its build system. See section OASIS for
full information.

Dependencies
============

In order to compile this package, you will need:

* ocaml (>= 3.12) for all, doc API
* findlib (>= 1.5)
* bytes for library lacaml

Installing
==========

1. Uncompress the source archive and go to the root of the package
2. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -configure'
3. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -build'
4. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -install'

Uninstalling
============

1. Go to the root of the package
2. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -uninstall'

OASIS
=====

OASIS is a program that generates a setup.ml file using a simple '_oasis'
configuration file. The generated setup only depends on the standard OCaml
installation: no additional library is required.

(* OASIS_STOP *)

Non-OCaml dependencies
======================

Get BLAS (preferably a more efficient ATLAS-implementation) and
LAPACK (see README for details) and install these libraries.

If the libraries are installed in a non-standard place, you may
need to set the paths (or additional flags) to setup.conf.
They will override the defaults set in setup.ml from _oasis.

If you use MacOS X, you may have to install vecLib, which is part of Apple's
Accelerate-framework.


Makefile compilation
====================

Go to the lib/ directory and issue (you will need GNU-make!):

make
make install

If the libraries are installed in a non-standard place, you may
need to set the paths to the include files and to the static or
shared libraries in Makefile.conf (variables INCDIRS, LIBDIRS,
BLAS and LAPACK) or on the command line.


Findlib
=======

Findlib can be found at http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html
If you use Linux, it is likely that there exists a package in your
distribution.
